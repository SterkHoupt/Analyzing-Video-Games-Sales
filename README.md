For our project, we have chosen a video game sales dataset. We aim to predict the future sales (numerical) of games based on genre, publisher, and platform. 
The dataset we have found is 🔥 EDA - VIDEO GAMES SALES 🎮. 
Linear regression parser is the algorithm that we will use, part of our goal being to factor in nominal attributes and do encoding.
